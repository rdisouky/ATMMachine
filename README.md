# ATMMachine
 An ATM Simulation that allows you to clearly deposit and withdraw money from a machine. It is smart enough to prevent you from withdrawing more than what you have so you can live debt free :) 

How to Run:

1-Clone this repository

2-Open atm-improvements.jsx file

3-Enjoy!

Roadmap of future improvements: I am hoping to improve the style making it more realictic and adding more options to the dropdown such as money transfers.
